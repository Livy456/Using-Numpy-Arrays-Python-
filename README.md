## Array_1
I was given a 2D array of heat-values (at fixed boundary) and tasked to write a program that produces the new heat distribution after one iteration of the finite difference method.

## Array_2
I was tasked to write a Python function that does the above, utilizing NumPy array arithmetic to vectorize the finite-difference method.

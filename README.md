Array_1
- I was tasked to write a Python function that implements the finite differences method to produce heat dispersion of material at the next time-step.

Array_2
- I was tasked to write a Python function that uses NumPy array arithmetic to vectorize the finite-difference method that had implemented in the previous task.
